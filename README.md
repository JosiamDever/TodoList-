## ðŸŽ¨ Design Rationale

**Plasmatic** follows the *Midnight Flow* direction: deep, near-black backgrounds with mild neon accents (cyan / purple) to create contrast and depth without overwhelming the user.

**Key decisions:**

- **Contrast & comfort:** Dark background reduces eye strain while neon accents guide attention to interactive elements (primary buttons, active task states).  
- **Element organization:** A split-panel dashboard â€” left sidebar for navigation, filters and progress; main panel for task creation and the list.  
- **Typography:** A compact, geometric sans-serif (e.g., *Inter* or *Space Grotesk*) for legibility at small sizes; optionally a monospaced accent for timestamps or metadata.  
- **Spacing & hierarchy:** Tight, consistent padding on cards with subtle elevation and micro-interactions (fade, slide) to create a tactile feel.
